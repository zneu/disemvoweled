### Disemvoweled

__Thank you for checking out the Disemvoweled application__

*This application was based on a lesson by Team Treehouse*

This application will accept strings separated by commas and will put them into a list. The user can SHOW the list, ask for HELP, and use the command DONE to quit the application. This application will return the list without any vowels and will capitalize the first letter of each word in the list.
